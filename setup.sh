Ontario Health: Lead, System Strategy, Planning, Design and Implementation (Primary Care) (R108147)

Dear Respected Hiring Manager,

Please accept my application for the Lead, System Strategy, Planning, Design and Implementation (Primary Care) position at Ontario Health (R108147), as referred by Sajjad Fazel.  

I bring a strong background in healthcare system optimization, project management, and digital transformation, all of which align with the objectives of this role. Throughout my career, I have worked to improve healthcare delivery by coordinating systems-level changes and facilitating collaboration across diverse teams.

At Sentrex Health Solutions, I played a pivotal role in transitioning from paper-based workflows to a fully digital system, integrating electronic medical records and automating administrative processes. This work improved the accessibility and efficiency of patient care and aligned with my passion for utilizing technology to drive better health outcomes. I worked closely with both clinical staff and technical teams to ensure a seamless transition, emphasizing training, stakeholder engagement, and process standardization, which mirrors the objectives of Ontario Health’s strategy for primary care.

In my role as a Case Manager Team Lead at the Ministry of Health, I developed and implemented standardized procedures during the COVID-19 crisis. By creating decision trees and streamlining communication between teams, I was able to facilitate timely responses to health system needs. These experiences in planning, coordinating, and executing complex projects have equipped me with the skills needed to manage and lead initiatives that enhance service delivery and system integration across Ontario’s health system.

I am confident in my ability to analyze data, identify system gaps, and foster strategic relationships to improve service delivery, all while working collaboratively across regions. My focus on improving the patient experience, ensuring integrated care, and engaging with diverse stakeholders aligns well with Ontario Health’s mission to transform healthcare delivery in Ontario.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Ontario Health’s vision and efforts to improve primary care across the province.

Best regards,  
Mehdi Kermally
